1. Assume I plan to use the friend_overlap function above to quantify the
similarity of two users. E.g., because 344 is larger than 1, I conclude that
Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are more similar than Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump.

How is this approach misleading? How might you fix it?

It only tell the quantity of friend_overlap. The similarity should be the 
ratio of the friend_overlap in each candidate.



2. Looking at the output of your followed_by_hillary_and_donald function, why
do you think this user is followed by both Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump,
who are rivals? Do some web searches to see if you can find out more
information.

MagicJohnson is a supporter for Hillary, I guess that's why Hillary follows him.
Bacause of MagicJohnson has some business with Trump, thus Trump follows him.



3. There is a big difference in how many accounts each candidate follows (Gary
Johnson follows over 3K accounts, while Donald Trump follows less than
50). Why do you think this is? How might that affect our analysis?

Maybe Trump only follows his properties, family members and business parteners.
The fewer the candidate follows, the less accuracy the analysis would be.



4. The follower graph we've collected is incomplete. To expand it, we would
have to also collect the list of accounts followed by each of the
friends. That is, for each user X that Donald Trump follows, we would have to
also collect all the users that X follows. Assuming we again use the API call
https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/friends/ids, how many requests will
we have to make? Given how Twitter does rate limiting
(https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting), approximately how many
minutes will it take to collect this data?

We have to get all friends they have by using following code:

def followed_by_all(users, twitter):
    hillary = []
    donald = []
    govgary = []
    drjill = []

    for i in users:
        if i['screen_name'] == 'HillaryClinton':
            hillary = i['friends']
        if i['screen_name'] == 'realDonaldTrump':
            donald = i['friends']
        if i['screen_name'] == 'GovGaryJohnson':
            govgary = i['friends']
        if i['screen_name'] == 'DrJillStein':
            drjill = i['friends']

    all_friends = set(hillary) | set(donald) | set(govgary) | set(drjill)
    target = list(all_friends)
    return len(target)

The result is 7685
For Twitter API in 15 mins, user can only request 15 times.
Each people candidate follows is a request, so it will take (7685 / 15) * 15, 
approximately 7685 mins to collect data.
